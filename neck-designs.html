Thank you for choosing Neck Designs. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, what we donâ€™t collect, and why.

1. Information We Do Not Collect
Our app is designed to be a simple and private experience. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information from you. This includes:
Your name, email address, or phone number.
The app functions completely offline and does not require you to create an account or provide any personal details.

2. How the App Works
Offline Functionality: The entire collection of neck designs is stored locally on your device. The app does not need an internet connection to work, and it does not communicate with any external servers to provide its core features.
Favorites Feature: When you save a design to your "Favorites," this information is stored only on your own device. We cannot see, access, or share your list of favorite designs. This data is private to you and is not sent to us or any third party.

3. Permissions
